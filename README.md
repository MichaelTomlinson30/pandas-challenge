The district consists of 15 schools, with a total student population of 39,170. The overall budget for the district is $24,649,428.

The overall passing rate, considering both math and reading, is 65.17%.
Math and reading scores tend to increase with higher grade levels, suggesting a positive correlation between grade level and academic performance.
Spending Analysis
There is no significant correlation between per student budget and academic performance. Schools with lower per student spending can outperform those with higher spending.
Size of the School
Small and medium-sized schools tend to have higher passing rates than large schools. This suggests that smaller class sizes may contribute to better academic performance.
Conclusion
While this analysis provides valuable insights into school and district performance, it is important to consider additional factors such as teacher qualifications, curriculum, and student demographics for a more comprehensive understanding. The data suggests that Charter schools generally outperform District schools, and there is no clear relationship between higher spending and better academic outcomes. Further investigation into specific school practices and policies may provide deeper insights for educational improvement.
